    <p>
      I’m <span class="highlight">Nirbhay Singla</span>, a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Sydney. I’m driven by building fast, learning fast, and solving real-world problems through hands-on engineering and emerging tech.
    </p>

    <p>
      I got my start in tech as a teenager, earning an Apple Scholarship early on. Since then, I’ve worked alongside ambitious founders, engineers, and creators — choosing to learn by building rather than following a strictly traditional path.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website is still a work in progress. For now, most of my ideas, experiments, and updates live on Twitter. I’ll be sharing more here as I continue building.

    <h2>Beliefs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>"Strive for ambition over comfort."</em> — I believe in pushing boundaries and would rather make ambitious mistakes than settle for mediocrity.</li>
      <li>Speed matters — not just velocity, but the learning loop it creates.</li>
      <li>Early growth is about rate of progress. Life is less a chess game and more a sprint of bold moves.</li>
      <li>In a post-GPT world, real leverage comes from building unique tech, not just distribution.</li>
      <li>People matter deeply. Kindness, transparency, and directness compound over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Drives Me?</h2>
    <p>
      In a world approaching technological abundance, I’m drawn to the deeper question: <em>"Why is there something rather than nothing?"</em> For me, understanding intelligence and cognition is central to unlocking the universe’s biggest mysteries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Until I have the means to mine asteroids, I’m focused on building with people who challenge me, move fast, and think deeply. That’s where I grow the most.
