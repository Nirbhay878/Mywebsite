  <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Nirbhay Singla, a first-semester Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Sydney. I’m passionate about technology, digital logic, and game development. Currently, I’m working on projects involving C programming, state machines, and 3D modeling.</p>
  
  <p>I love engaging with people from different backgrounds, exchanging ideas, and challenging myself through sports like swimming and chess. I’m also excited to be part of the USyd Rocketry Team and explore the fascinating world of aerospace technology.</p>
  
  <p>This website is a space where I share my journey, projects, and passions. Feel free to explore my work and get in touch if you'd like to connect or collaborate.</p>
